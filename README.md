Much of the layout and ideas on navigation for my blog came from [**Kevin Marquette's blog**](https://powershellexplained.com/). I recommend checking his blog out. It is a terrific resource for learning PowerShell.

# Blog Creation
When I had to redo my local blog development space, I followed a great video by [Bill Raymond](https://www.youtube.com/c/WilliamRaymondPM/about) on YouTube, [Develop Jekyll websites in a container (including GitHub Pages)](https://youtu.be/owHfKAbJ6_M).

This video walks you step-by-step in creating a local docker container and using VSCode to edit a blog.

Once the framework was in place, I downloaded the latest release of Beautiful Jekyll and customized it to my needs.
