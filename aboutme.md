### Hello,


I'm a technology professional who's worked in IT for over 20 years. For much of that time, I've focused on virtualization platforms from **Citrix**, **VMware**, and **Microsoft** and  related technologies and tools to automate, monitor, and manage the end user experience. I've worked in many diverse environments such as architecture, small business, manufacturing/distribution, medical (hospital and medical devices), government (federal), and industrial (chemical and electronics) all with an IT focus.

I now work in North Carolina for the second largest credit union in the USA.

I'm currently a [**Citrix Certified Expert in Virtualization**](https://www.credly.com/badges/d0ec8210-1df1-46c9-832a-9ea9d68a8477){:target="_blank"} which also includes the [**Citrix Professional**](https://www.credly.com/badges/c5d5dacc-923a-467a-bc94-3bcdeeb5aefe){:target="_blank"} and the [**Citrix Associate**](https://www.credly.com/badges/92539693-3fd4-4be7-9895-052e984718c7){:target="_blank"} certifications. I'm also starting to dive into Cloud platforms. I'm [**Microsoft Certified in Azure Fundamentals**](https://www.credly.com/badges/c90b4e86-c2e9-419b-9c57-f6e801010862){:target="_blank"}.  In addition, I also have [**CompTia's Network+**](https://www.credly.com/badges/d8f50606-7cff-456a-ad30-7b2f95f883df){:target="_blank"}.

In September 2017, I was inducted into the [**Citrix Technology Advocates Program**](https://www.credly.com/badges/0958b5f9-561c-4997-8354-66260be98368){:target="_blank"}. I've been renewed for this terrific program 2018-2022. Also in September 2017, my first blog: [**Wagthereal.com**](https://wagthereal.com){:target="_blank"} was included in [**Feedspot's Top 50 PowerShell Blogs And Websites For Developers**](http://blog.feedspot.com/powershell_blogs/){:target="_blank"}

In June 2018, I became a leader of the Raleigh-Durham Citrix User Group.
